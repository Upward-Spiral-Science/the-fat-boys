**Overview**
Synapses are the fundamental building blocks of neuronal communication. While there has been recent attempts to classify cell types based on genetics and imaging, there has been no attempt to classify synapses into sub-groups besides the classical distinction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. It is well known that synaptic dysfunction can cause many different kinds of diseases such as fragile X and Rett Syndrome. The study and characterization of synapses is thus a clinically important problem that could potentially improve our understanding of diseases that affect millions of patients. In this study, we use well-validated markers and high resolution electron microscopy to tackle the question of synaptic diversity. With the unprecedented scale and resolution of our data, the study could characterize different classes of synapses and potentially yield further insights linking molecules and genes to synaptic structure and diseases.
