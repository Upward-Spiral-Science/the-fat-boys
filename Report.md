**Overview**


Synapses are the fundamental building blocks of neuronal communication. While there has been recent attempts to classify cell types based on genetics and imaging, there has been no attempt to classify synapses into sub-groups besides the classical distinction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. It is well known that synaptic dysfunction can cause many different kinds of diseases such as fragile X and Rett Syndrome. The study and characterization of synapses is thus a clinically important problem that could potentially improve our understanding of diseases that affect millions of patients. In this study, we use well-validated markers and high resolution electron microscopy to tackle the question of synaptic diversity. With the unprecedented scale and resolution of our data, the study could characterize different classes of synapses and potentially yield further insights linking molecules and genes to synaptic structure and diseases.

**Scientific Questioning**


Here we will discuss our analysis of this data, starting with exploratory and descriptive analysis, up to preliminary work on hypothesis testing and classification. The questions posed and their outcomes are described sequentially, with code and methods used to answer them described at the end of this report.


**Descriptive Analysis**


The natural first step when working with any data is to ask exploratory and descriptive questions about it. We have access to the KDM-SYN-100824B dataset, which is composed of 24 conjugate array tomography images of 41 brain slices from the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Each conjugate array tomography image corresponds to a specific immunostain marker. Our collaborator has already pre-processed the images to generate two secondary sets, which we will call the “marker set” and the “pivot set.” We will primarily rely on these two sets throughout our analysis. The former set contains information about the intensity and distribution of the molecular markers within individual synapses seen in the KDM-SYN-100824B images. The latter set contains the x,y, and slice location of the relevant synapses within the former dataset. In order to determine the structure of our data, we first attempted to determine basic information: dataset size and number of invalid (i.e. Inf/Na/NaN) data points within the data. We found that the marker dataset has data for 1,119,299 subjects (synapses) and 144 features for each subject. Each 6 consecutive features, to our best guess, correspond to a single fluorescent marker, for a total of 144/6 = 24 markers. Upon further investigation, we found that only the first 4 of the 6 features for each marker were relevant for further analysis, so we discarded the last 2. Hence, our feature size was reduced to 4 * 24 = 96. The pivot dataset has data for the same 1,119,299 synapses and l 3 features. These 3 features, as stated above, correspond to the x-location, y-location, and slice number for the corresponding synapse in the conjugate array tomography images. There were no invalid data points within the secondary datasets. For the rest of our analysis, we will focus on the marker set.
