We observed colocalization of GabaR and VGlut1 (it seems like Jesse has also observed that).

There are 3 possibilities here: 

1. Neuroscience (existing knowledge) is wrong 

2. Our analysis is wrong

3. The data is wrong

It is unlikely that our analysis is wrong since Jesse and us independently replicated that result. 

In order to gauge our sanity here, I have conducted a literature search. 

**From Valente et al 2015**

In the last years, an increasing amount of experimental evidence has demonstrated an abundant coexpression
of VGLUT1 and VGAT in retina bipolar cells as well as in cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic synapses
(Kao et al. 2004; Fattorini et al. 2009; Zander et al. 2010). Moreover, electrophysiological studies suggested
that GABA is coreleased from glutamatergic hippocampal mossy fiber terminals (MFTs) during postnatal development
(Walker et al. 2001; Gutiérrez 2003; Safiulina et al. 2006) or  in the adult after induction of hyperexcitability
(Gutiérrez 2000; Gutiérrez and Heinemann 2001; Gómez-Lira et al. 2002; RomoParra et al. 2003; Treviño and Gutiérrez 2005)
. Although initially argued (Uchigashima et al. 2007), the growing and convincing experimental evidence (Safiulina et al. 2006
; for review, see Gutiérrez 2009; Beltrán and Gutiérrez 2012; Cabezas et al. 2012) strengthened considerably the notion of GABA
corelease at MFs. Previous data have shown that GABA, coreleased at these glutamatergic synapses, mainly activates postsynaptic
(Gutiérrez 2003; Safiulina et al. 2006) and presynaptic (Ruiz et al. 2003) ionotropic type A GABA receptors (GABAARs).
