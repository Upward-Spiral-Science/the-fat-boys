1. Per Jovo's suggestion, we should come up with quantitative methods to evaluate the clustering rather than just doing it visually. 
Hence, as suggested by Hal Duame III's paper in JMLR, we could use the ARI, the Precision/Recall/F-score, the  Cluster Edit Distance and Normalized Edit Score, as well
as the Variation of Information.
2. Per Jovo's suggestion, we should make sure that the 2 synap markers and the 2 VGlut1 markers are strongly correlated. We can make sure that 
this is the case by inspecting the correlation matrix, and doing a scatterplot of the data points. 
3. We should perform the same analysis as before on features 3 and 4 in addition to just the integrated and local brightness. 
4. We should perform the same analysis as before on additional markers in addition to just the excitatory and inhibitory ones. For example, 
we should take into account 5HT, NOS, CR1 etc. 
5. We should explore the computer vision part more with the MATLAB code that our team has written. In paerticular, we observed holes in the 
image that we suspect are cell bodies. To confirm that, we can "digitally counterstain" with DAPI.
