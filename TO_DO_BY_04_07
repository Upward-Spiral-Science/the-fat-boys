Kevin Huang:
  1) Coming up with two other metrics to evaulaute the validity of each called synapse on the raw synapsin channel image
  2) Quantify and assign a p-value to each called synapse based on the metric above
  3) Finalize on a metric that effectively discrimately elimate the noise in the synapsins channel 
  4) Try out DBscan clustering on the new data
  5) Use ARI and MNI to evaluate the clustering results
  
Ivan Kuznetsov:
  1) Use ARI to evaluate marker clustering results presented in last weeks results
  2) Generate pseudo-labels for excitoary/inhbiitory ppre/post-synaptic via the methid presented in last weeks results 
  3) Implement RF clustering
  4) Try rank-based clustering methods for marker clustering
  5) Try rank-based clustering methods for synapse clustering
