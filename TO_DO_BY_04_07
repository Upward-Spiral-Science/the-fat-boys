Kevin Huang:
  1) Coming up with two other metrics to evaulaute the validity of each called synapse on the raw synapsin channel image
  2) Quantify and assign a p-value to each called synapse based on the metric above
  3) Finalize on a metric that effectively discrimately elimate the noise in the synapsins channel 
  4) Try out DBscan clustering on the new data
  5) Use ARI and MNI to evaluate the clustering results.
